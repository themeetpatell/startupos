# 🎯 Top 5 Critical Features - Zero Third-Party Dependencies

## Research Summary: Why Startups Fail in 2025

Based on current ecosystem analysis:
- **42%** fail due to no market need (lack of PMF)
- **29%** run out of cash (poor runway management)
- **23%** lack the right team/talent
- **19%** get outcompeted
- **17%** have pricing/cost issues

**Critical Finding**: Most failures are due to **poor decision-making** caused by lack of real-time intelligence, customer insights, and systematic validation frameworks.
